## Unemplotment Analysis With Python

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate
can be a good data science project.

- In this task, I use India's Unemployee Analysis dataset. And carried out many analyses using Python.
- I analysed the data using pandas and numpy to draw conclusions.
- I have done several data visualizations and animations using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.
- It provides a thorough picture of the unemployment situation across states, aiding in making wise decisions.
