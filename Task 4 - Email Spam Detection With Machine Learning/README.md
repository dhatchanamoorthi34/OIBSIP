# Email Spam Detection With Machine Learning
- In this task, I used the SMS Spam collection dataset.
- Then, I trained the model using a Count Vectorizer and Logistic Regression Algorithms.
- There are many analyses that were done, and a few visualizations were also done.
- Finally, Using the MultinomialNB Algorithm, made a model and predicted using custom words.
