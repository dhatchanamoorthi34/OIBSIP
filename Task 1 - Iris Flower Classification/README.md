# Iris Flower Classification 

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

- In this task, I took Iris Flower dataset and performed Logistic Regression Algorithm to make model.
- It finally categorized flowers into species.
- I got an accuracy of 97.37% and It demonstrates that the model I created is extremely accurate.
- And I predicted the Species using a fresh set of data and obtained an accurate result.
